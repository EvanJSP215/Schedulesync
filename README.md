## Final Thoughts

If you made it all the way here, Thank you for taking a read of my group capstone project. 

This was made with a team of 5 with an endgoal of creating a product that can have impact in local communities. 

In addition, we were also able to learn new languages, frameworks and have the ability to showcase this project at University at Buffalo - State University of New York CSE Demo Day.
